    <h2>About Sex Ed Inc. – our values, our aims, and our programs</h2>
<br><p>Sex Ed Inc. believes that openness and inclusivity benefits everyone, particularly when it comes to sex and relationships. Often young people feel that the education they receive on sex and relationships doesn’t cater to them, leaves out crucial bits of knowledge, or is presented in a way that’s judgemental of their choices and identities. This can mean they don’t feel comfortable asking questions, and makes it harder for them to be equipped to make smart, safe choices that they are happy with.</p>
  <p>Sex Ed Inc. wants to change this by making sure that all young people in the UK and informed and aware about sex and relationships. We do this by providing a hub of online information on sex and relationships that aims to be as inclusive as possible of factors including sexuality, ethnicity, gender identity, and disability which all might impact young peoples’ experiences around sex and relationships. We also have a small team of educators who go into schools and colleges to provide interactive seminars for students and training for teachers, and who run weekend workshops and activities at youth centres. To book a session or to enquire about what we offer and how we can work with you to deliver high quality sex and relationships education, just contact us</p>
